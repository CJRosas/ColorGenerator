# ColorGenerator App
The newest addition to my growing collection of simple apps to help me learn Swift is the ColorGenerator!

# Usage
This app is arguably simpler than its predecessor. Simply, open the app and tap the screen to generate a random background color!

# Who Would Want This?
This app is great for people looking for randomly generated colors for phone backgrounds or instagram story backgrounds.
Its also generally useful for those looking for new colors or color inspirations for their own projects!
