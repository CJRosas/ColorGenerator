# ColorGenerator App
This wonderfully simple app was created using swift and made with those who like colors, simple tap controls, and hex codes in mind!

## Usage
Simply, open the app and tap the screen to generate a random background color! The color hex code is displayed in the bottom left corner so if you find a color you like, you can screenshot or write down the code for usage in your own project!


## Who Would Want This?
- This app is *great* for people looking for randomly generated colors for phone backgrounds or instagram story backgrounds.
- It can also be useful for those looking for new colors or color inspirations for their own projects!
- If neither of these suit your fancy, it is a nice fidget app to have on hand and just tap through colorful screens and distract yourself from your surroundings for a few minutes.
